The following repository contains two folders for the assignment these can be found in the main branch of the repository. In the source files folder all the java files that are included: Apple.java AppleFactory.java GroceryProduct.java GroceryProductFactory.java Main.java Orange.java OrangeFactory.java PriceReader.java. In the test files folder is the text file prices.txt.

The test method is located in the Main.java file. In the main method the code proceeds to read the text prices.txt for products and their prices. Upon reading the contents of the file it instantiates an object using the GroceryProductFacotry interface which then forwards the information from the file to the appropriate subclass where the products name and price are set. It then prints this information.
